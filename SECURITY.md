### Data handling

### Cookies / browser integration

- The app does **not** upload cookies anywhere.
- Cookies are read from your chosen browser profile by `yt-dlp` and used locally for the download session.
- To stop using cookies, disable the toggle in the app.
- To remove cookies, clear them in your browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Brave) using the browser settings.
